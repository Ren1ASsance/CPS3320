# Animal Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of an animal image classification model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify images of 10 different animal species. The dataset used for training is available on Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can classify images into one of 10 animal categories. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using PyTorch. The dataset consists of labeled images of different animals, and we use it to train a model capable of recognizing animals in new, unseen images.

### Dataset Download

To download the dataset, you need to have a Kaggle account. You can download the dataset from [Hugging face](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10). After downloading, you can extract the images and place them in the appropriate directory structure for training.
